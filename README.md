# Image Mosaic Project

The goal of this project is to build the best panoramic views and compare outcomes of different settings. The idea is to understand what are the key factors to achieve good stitching between photos, and also understand what factors can make this task worse to avoid them and be aware of them when creating panoramic photos.
